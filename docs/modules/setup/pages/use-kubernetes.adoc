This section describes how to install Kroki on Kubernetes using the `default` namespace.

On this page you will find how to:

* [x] Use `Ingress` to expose the service on port 8000.
* [x] Download and extract the example Kroki kubernetes definition files
* [x] Install the Kubernetes objects as a batch or one by one.
* [x] Validate the installation
* [x] Delete the Kroki installation

.Providing external access to Kroki
[IMPORTANT]
====
To allow external access to your Kroki internal service,
you publish the service using `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer` or `ExternalName`.

This example uses `Ingress` to expose the service on port 8000.

Read more about how to publish a service on the {uri-k8s-docs-publish-service}[Kubernetes documentation] website.
====

== Extract the Kubernetes object definition files
Prepare the Kubernetes definition files by doing the following:

. Download the example bundle link:{attachmentsdir}/kroki-k8s-multipod.zip[`kroki-k8s-multipod.zip`] that contains all the required `Deployment`, `Service` and `Ingress` definition files to deploy Kroki on Kubernetes.
+
.Example command with `wget` installed
[source,cli]
----
wget http://docs.kroki.io/kroki/setup/_attachments/kroki-k8s-multipod.zip -O kroki-k8s-multipod.zip
----

. Extract the contents of the above zip file into a folder named `kroki-k8s`.
+
.Example command with `unzip` installed
[source,cli]
----
unzip kroki-k8s-multipod.zip -d kroki-k8s
----

In the next steps you use the `*.yml` files beneath the directory `kroki-k8s` and apply them in batch or individually, to create the Kubernetes objects.

== Create objects as a batch

To install (create) all the Kubernetes objects in a batch do the following:

Use the command `kubectl apply` to create all the required Kubernetes objects,
replacing _/path/to/kroki-k8s_ with the path to the folder containing the `*.yaml` definition files.

.Example command
[source,cli,subs=+quotes]
----
kubectl apply -f _/path/to/kroki-k8s_
----

Your next step is to <<Validate that Kroki is running>>.

Read more about working with kubernetes objects on the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/[Kubernetes] website.

== Create objects individually
Alternatively they can be applied individually.

To install them individually from GitHub, open a terminal and type commands indicated for each service:

.Add Mermaid service
[source,cli,subs=+attributes]
----
kubectl apply -f {uri-k8s-kroki-examples}/mermaid-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f {uri-k8s-kroki-examples}/mermaid-service.yaml
----

.Add BPMN service
[source,cli,subs=+attributes]
----
kubectl apply -f {uri-k8s-kroki-examples}/bpmn-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f {uri-k8s-kroki-examples}/bpmn-service.yaml
----

.Add Excalidraw service
[source,cli,subs=+attributes]
----
kubectl apply -f {uri-k8s-kroki-examples}/excalidraw-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f {uri-k8s-kroki-examples}/excalidraw-service.yaml
----

.Add Kroki service
[source,cli,subs=+attributes]
----
kubectl apply -f {uri-k8s-kroki-examples}/kroki-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f {uri-k8s-kroki-examples}/kroki-service.yaml
----

.Add Ingress
[source,cli,subs=+attributes]
kubectl apply -f {uri-k8s-kroki-examples}/kroki-ingress.yaml

Your next step is to <<Validate that Kroki is running>>.

== Validate that Kroki is running
After installing the Kroki Kubernetes objects you verify that Kroki is running.

To verify that the Kroki service is running do the following:

. Run the `kubectl get pod` command:
[source,cli]
kubectl get pod
+
If the installation is successful a list of running pods is shown that includes the following:
+
....
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
bpmn-6cfccf9bc4-6w4px         1/1     Running   0          24s
excalidraw-5b84995fcb-dh57t   1/1     Running   0          24s
kroki-6b49bcb7c4-x2ksc        1/1     Running   0          23s
mermaid-7bff5c9959-hkrxx      1/1     Running   0          22s
....

. To make sure that Kroki is working, open a terminal and type:
[source,cli]
kubectl port-forward service/kroki 8000:8000
+
The above command forwards local port 8000 to port 8000 on the `service/kroki` Pod.
In other words, Kroki is accessible on localhost:8000.

. Open a second terminal and type:
[source,cli]
curl http://localhost:8000/seqdiag/svg/eNorTi1MyUxMV6jmUlBIKsovL04tUtC1UyhPTQKyyoCc6JzEpNQcBVsFJXfXEAX9zLyU1Aq9jJLcHKVYayQ9Nrq6CE3WhA0L8A8GmpaUk5-un5yfm5uaVwIxD6EWqDElsSQxKbE4FUmfp1-wa1CIAg49IFfANOFxXS0A68hQUg==
+
If successful, a diagram is shown.

== Uninstall Kroki
If you installed Kroki using the downloaded and unpacked `*.yaml` files, Kroki can be deleted using those same files.

To uninstall Kroki use the command `kubectl delete` as follows:

[source,cli,subs=+quotes]
kubectl delete -f _/path/to/kroki-k8s_

== Using a Single Pod Consisting of Multiple Containers
As a much simpler (but less-flexible) configuration, it is possible to run all containers inside of a single Kubernetes pod.

. Download the example bundle link:{attachmentsdir}/kroki-k8s-singlepod.zip[`kroki-k8s-singlepod.zip`] that contains all the required `Deployment`, `Service` and `Ingress` definition files to deploy Kroki on Kubernetes.
+
.Example command with `wget` installed
[source,cli]
----
wget http://docs.kroki.io/kroki/setup/_attachments/kroki-k8s-singlepod.zip -O kroki-k8s-singlepod.zip
----

. Extract the contents of the above zip file into a folder named `kroki-k8s`.
+
.Example command with `unzip` installed
[source,cli]
----
unzip kroki-k8s-singlepod.zip -d kroki-k8s
----

You can then create the Kubernetes objects as a batch or individually, similar to what was shown previously.

Validation and uninstall/removal of Kubernetes objects can be followed using the exact same commands as shown previously too.
